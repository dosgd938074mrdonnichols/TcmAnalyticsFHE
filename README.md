# TcmAnalyticsFHE

**TcmAnalyticsFHE** is a privacy-preserving platform for analyzing Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) patient records.  
It allows multiple TCM clinics to share encrypted patient data and perform **joint analysis** using **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)**, enabling discovery of prescription patterns while keeping patient privacy and clinic knowledge confidential.

---

## Project Background

TCM clinics often face challenges in knowledge sharing and data analysis:

- **Patient Privacy:** Sensitive patient records cannot be shared freely.  
- **Clinic Confidentiality:** Proprietary experience and prescription knowledge is difficult to transfer.  
- **Data Scarcity:** Limited data in individual clinics hinders effective pattern discovery.  
- **Analysis Risk:** Centralized aggregation may expose sensitive data.

TcmAnalyticsFHE addresses these challenges by enabling:

- **Encrypted multi-party computation** across clinics without decrypting records.  
- **Secure mining of prescription and symptom associations**.  
- **Knowledge transfer** from experienced practitioners while maintaining privacy.  
- **Preservation of clinic secrets and patient confidentiality**.

## Core Concepts

### üîí Encrypted TCM Records
Patient data (syndromes, prescriptions, symptoms) are encrypted at the source.  
FHE ensures that computations are performed directly on ciphertexts, never exposing raw records.

### üìä Collaborative Analysis
Clinics contribute encrypted data for:

- Pattern mining of common prescriptions.  
- Discovery of syndrome-formula associations.  
- Statistical insights into treatment effectiveness.  

All computations are homomorphic, ensuring data remains confidential.

### üß† Knowledge Preservation
- Experienced practitioners‚Äô insights can guide encrypted analysis.  
- Patterns and rules are extracted without revealing individual cases.  
- Supports clinical decision-making and research while preserving trade secrets.

### ‚öñÔ∏è Privacy and Compliance
- Patient anonymity and clinic confidentiality are enforced.  
- Only encrypted statistics or learned rules are shared.  
- Prevents leakage of sensitive medical and proprietary information.

## Why FHE Matters

Fully Homomorphic Encryption enables **computation over encrypted data**:

1. **Data Privacy:** Patient records remain encrypted at all times.  
2. **Trustless Collaboration:** Clinics can jointly analyze data without trusting a central authority.  
3. **Confidential Insights:** Analytical results can be shared without revealing raw records.  
4. **Knowledge Security:** Proprietary TCM experience is protected while contributing to research.

FHE is critical to maintaining **legal compliance**, protecting **patient rights**, and **preserving clinic expertise**.

## Architecture

The system comprises three main layers:

### 1. Encrypted Data Layer
- Stores patient syndromes, prescriptions, and outcomes as ciphertext.  
- Encrypts records locally at the clinic before any transmission.  
- Ensures that raw patient data is never exposed.

### 2. Homomorphic Computation Layer
- Performs joint statistical analysis on encrypted data.  
- Implements association rule mining to discover frequent prescriptions.  
- Supports encrypted correlation analysis and pattern detection.

### 3. Result Extraction Layer
- Produces aggregate insights, trends, and rules in encrypted form.  
- Decrypts only authorized aggregated results, never individual patient data.  
- Allows clinics to benefit from multi-party analysis without compromising privacy.

## Example Workflow

1. **Data Preparation**  
   - Clinic encrypts patient records locally using FHE.  
   - Records include symptoms, syndromes, prescriptions, and outcomes.

2. **Encrypted Submission**  
   - Ciphertext is shared to the collaborative analysis system.  
   - No raw data leaves the clinic.

3. **Joint Analysis**  
   - FHE computation discovers patterns across clinics.  
   - Association rules and statistics are generated on encrypted data.

4. **Result Access**  
   - Clinics receive aggregated, privacy-preserving insights.  
   - Individual records remain confidential and unverifiable externally.
